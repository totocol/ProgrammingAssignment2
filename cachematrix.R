## Programming Assignment 2 - please give me a good mark :)
## I'm trying really hard :)

## This first function will create a matrix that I am going to try and cache

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Write a short comment describing this function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
