## Programming Assignment 2 
## I'm enjoying this class

## This first function will create a matrix that I am going to try and cache

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## This will use the value from the matrix that was cached above


cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
